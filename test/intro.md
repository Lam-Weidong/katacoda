# Introduction

This is a really compelling introduction!

I can put code here:

```
var variable = 123;  
echo(variable);
```

Click this next line to run the code in the terminal:

`echo "Muhahahahaha!"`{{execute}}

Keep in mind you can cancel most terminal processes by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
